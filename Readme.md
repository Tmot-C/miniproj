Wooperdex is an in progress Pokedex/Teambuilder with more functionality to come (maybe).

The app uses a Java Springboot backend using the Thymeleaf template engine for passing data and just a smidge of javascript for an edge usecase.
CSS and Bootstrap is used to style the application.
Redis is used to cache the Pokedex data and store user teams.

Wooperdex is largely inspired by the Pokemon Showdown simulator, it's intended to have competitive info for easy reference.

All 1025 Pokemon (sans extra forms and regional variants) are viewable in the dex.
You can jump to any pokemon if you know their ID number, or display the pokemon according to the generation they debuted in.
You can create an account to be able to access the teambuilder.
In the teambuilder, you can view your chosen pokemon and select the moves and abilities you want them to have (Visualisation only as of now).
